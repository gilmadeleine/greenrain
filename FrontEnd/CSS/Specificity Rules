1. Equal specificity: the latest rule counts - If the same rule is written twice into the external style sheet, 
then the lower rule in the style sheet is closer to the element to be styled, and therefore will be applied:
Example

h1 {background-color: yellow;}
h1 {background-color: red;}

2. A class selector beats any number of element selectors - a class selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc:
<html>
<head>
<style>
.intro {background-color: yellow;}
h1 {background-color: red;}
</style>
</head>
<body>

<h1 class="intro">This is a heading</h1>

</body>
</html>

The universal selector and inherited values have a specificity of 0 - *, body * and similar have a zero specificity. 
Inherited values also have a specificity of 0.
